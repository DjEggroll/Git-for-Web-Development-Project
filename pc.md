## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.

It is essentially a version tracker.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

GitHub is where repositories are hosted for people to access or utilize Git for making changes to the original repository.


3. Why do we create a branch?

A branch is an independent line of development.

Creating a branch allows for multiple individuals to make changes to the original repository that are isolated from other individual branches. You can then merge the branches if needed as long as they belong to the same repository.


4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

The pull request is used to notify your teammates that you have finished making changes and they need to be reviewed.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

git checkout main

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

git fetch downloads all changes without updating your most recent commit

git merge will combine your branch with another branch and create a single branch

git pull downloads all changes like git fetch, but it will update your most recent commit

7. What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two different branches have made changes to the same thing and you try to combine the branches into a single branch.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

You will have to go through each file and resolve the conflict by choosing which edit you want to keep, remove, or change.
